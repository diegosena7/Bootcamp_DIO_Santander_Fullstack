                <a href="https://www.santosfc.com.br/" target="_blank">Santos Futebol Clube</a> was founded by the initiative of three local sportsmen, Francisco Raymundo Marques, Mário Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza Junior. They invited all those who were interested in taking part in the inaugural meeting of the new club, which was created to promote the practice of soccer, a sport that was introduced in Brazil at the beginning of the previous century.

                The historic meeting took place at the headquarters of Concordia Club, at the former address, 18 Rosário Street (currently 8/10 João Pessoa Street), on April 14, 1912. The 39 attendees are considered to be the founding members of the club.
